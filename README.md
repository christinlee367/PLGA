Using machine learning modeling, we created a random forest model for processing characteristics of murine cells to predict which of the three treatments it received. We perform feature engineering utilizing correlation matrices between the features, Variation Inflation Factor (VIF) scores, and their Permutation Importance (PI) scores.
