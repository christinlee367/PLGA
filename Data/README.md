We collected murine cells and administered different treatments of DOX, DOX with PLGA, and kept untreated cells for control. They were then run through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), a type of flow cytometry focused on measuring protein expressions in each cell. We obtained 17 FACS fluorescent channels measuring different cell qualities, with 440,000 samples of cells for each class of treatment for a total of 1.3 million cells, which constitutes our dataset.
